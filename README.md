# In designing my resume, I chose to embody the 'Jester' archetype. The Jester is fun, lighthearted, and aims to bring joy to the world
# I selected 'Comic Sans' because of not only its readability but how it's fun and playful. Comic Sans font was inspired by the font used in comic books. 
# For my color scheme, I used neon yellow(ccff15) and neon purple(#7d12ff). I used neon colors because they are fun and add excitement to any image. 
# The background image is a cartoon sky. I based this image on the cartoons I grew up watching such as Spongebob SquarePants and Adventure Time. Like the Jester archetype, the cartoons were fun and lighthearted and always made me laugh
